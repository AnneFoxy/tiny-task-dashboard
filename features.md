# Features

Proposed features for Tiny Task Dashboard

- Task completion (mark tasks done)
- Edit task text in-place
- Due dates and sorting by due date
- Tags and filtering
- Search tasks
- Simple user sessions (no auth) to remember view prefs
- Drag to reorder (priority)
- Desktop notifications for overdue tasks
- Database support (MongoDB Atlas) — replace file-based storage with a hosted DB for persistence and multi-instance use
- JWT-based auth (optional) — add JSON Web Token support for simple authenticated sessions and API protection

Chosen subset to start with:
1. Task completion (mark tasks done)
2. Edit task text in-place (already present but polish)
3. Due dates and sorting by due date
4. Tags and basic filtering
5. Database support (MongoDB Atlas)
6. JWT-based auth (optional)
